          <ul>
            <li>
              We offer a longer list of scales than most sites, many outside of typical western music, 
              <br>and are always looking to add more.

        </li>
        <li>Searching for Keys:
          <ul>
            <li>Quickly find a key by searching for its name, e.g. 'C# mixolydian' or just 'mixolydian'
              <br>Don't know the name? Find any key by some of the notes you're playing,
              <br>e.g. 'A, B, C#, D, F, Gb.'
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Equivalent Keys:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Let's say you're playing notes that fit in 'E major,' but you feel like the root is in 'Db.'
              <br>If you know your theory, you might know that you're actually playing in 'Db aeolian.'
              <br>What about if you're playing notes that seem to fit in 'E dorian #4?'
              <br>Guitarizard will let you know you're looking for 'Db locrian 6.'
